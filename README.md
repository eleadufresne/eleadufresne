## 👋 About Me  

Hello World! I'm Éléa, a naturally strategic thinker (INTJ if that means anything to you), and I enjoy breaking things down to understand how they work. I thrive on challenging tasks, pulling all-nighters coding, and constantly seeking to learn new things. Over time, I've learned that collaboration and shared goals lead to the best solutions. 

I graduated from McGill last year with a B.Sc. in Honours Computer Science, and since then, I've fully immersed myself in open-source and independent learning. My background spans QA, software engineering, DevOps, and edge-computing research.
